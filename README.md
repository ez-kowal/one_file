<br><br>


## [bubble_sort.py](https://github.com/ez-kowal/one_file/blob/main/bubble_sort.py)
as the name of this file sugests this a quick script i made in april 2021, when i tried learning bubble sort algorith so 
this simple script incloudes buuble sort algorith.


## [rich_presence.py](https://github.com/ez-kowal/one_file/blob/main/rich_presence.py)
Made this script in January 2021, for fun when i was bored while having online school so i made a quick script to make a 
custom presence on discord that shows you are watching the hub.


## [xfetch.py](https://github.com/ez-kowal/one_file/blob/main/xfetch.py)
May 2021 i was inspired to make my own version of neofetch/pfetch/any other program that show you 
useless info about your system so you can flex with them online, so i made my own crappy clone i python.

here is a preview of xfetch.py:

## [unit_convert.py](https://github.com/ez-kowal/one_file/blob/main/unit_convert.py)
This is small script that can convert base-16/10/8/2 between each other.
it uses 0 libraries to convert numbers only pure python.
There is an extra function to convert a decimal(base10) to roman numeral.
